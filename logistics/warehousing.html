            <strong>COLD STORAGE WAREHOUSE</strong> </br>
        Cold storage does exactly what its name implies: it stores temperature sensitive items at low temperatures. Cold storage warehouses allow medicine, perishable foods, plants, cosmetics, artwork, and candles to have longer lives. 
        Cold storage warehouses also use refrigerated shipping for inbound and outbound shipping.</br></p>

      <p><strong>CUSTOMS BONDED WAREHOUSE</strong> </p>
      “customs” warehouses, a bonded warehouse is a building in which
      imported goods may be stored, manipulated, or undergo manufacturing operations
      without payment of duty for five years from date of acceptance. The duty on imported
      goods can be very high so the bonded warehouse allows the products to be sold first,
      and then duty is paid from the proceeds of the sale.

      <p>
        <strong>PICK,PACK, & SHIP WAREHOUSE</strong></br></p>
      In a warehouse, pick, pack, and ship is the process that happens after an order is received, either from an online store or a brick and mortar store. 
      The warehouse receives a pick list of products, and people or automated systems find the products within the warehouse.
      Then, they are packed for shipping, labeled, and shipped to the customer

      <P><strong>FOOD GRADE WAREHOUSE</strong></P>
      <p>A food-grade warehouse is a specialized facility that provides different types of storage for food products, including ambient, refrigerated, and frozen space.
      All food grade facilities must register with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and undergo annual inspections. </p>
