      <h3>Transportation</h3>
      <p>
        Transportation is the process of physically delivering products
        from the manufacturer to the distributor or dealer, as well as from the dealer to the ultimate consumer.
        Generally, businesses are engaged just until the distributor or dealer receives the product. Following that, the distributor is responsible for delivery to the final consumer
        However, transportation is a cost to the dealer as well, reducing his profit – forcing the business to increase the dealer’s profit to offset his expenses.

      <h3>Warehousing</h3>
      <p>
        Warehousing is the process of keeping completed products until they are sold. It is critical to a business’s logistical operations. The success of an organization’s marketing is contingent upon making the right warehousing choice. 
        Today, warehousing is seen as a switching facility rather than as a repository for poor warehouse management. Warehousing is a critical area of decision-making in logistics.</br>
        <p>Types of Warehouses:</p>

        COLD STORAGE WAREHOUSE </br>
        Cold storage does exactly what its name implies: it stores temperature sensitive items at low temperatures. Cold storage warehouses allow medicine, perishable foods, plants, cosmetics, artwork, and candles to have longer lives. 
        Cold storage warehouses also use refrigerated shipping for inbound and outbound shipping.</br>

      <p>BONDED WAREHOUSE</p>
      “customs” warehouses, a bonded warehouse is a building in which
      imported goods may be stored, manipulated, or undergo manufacturing operations
      without payment of duty for five years from date of acceptance. The duty on imported
      goods can be very high so the bonded warehouse allows the products to be sold first,
      and then duty is paid from the proceeds of the sale.

      <p>PICK,PACK, & SHIP WAREHOUSE></p> 
      In a warehouse, pick, pack, and ship is the process that happens after an order is received, either from an online store or a brick and mortar store. 
      The warehouse receives a pick list of products, and people or automated systems find the products within the warehouse.
      Then, they are packed for shipping, labeled, and shipped to the customer

      <P>FOOD GRADE WAREHOUSE</P>
      A food-grade warehouse is a specialized facility that provides different types of storage for food products, including ambient, refrigerated, and frozen space.
      All food grade facilities must register with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and undergo annual inspections.
