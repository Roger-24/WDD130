        <p>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river.
             The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the
              people living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and 
              fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.
        Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn
         sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring
          ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and 
          provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.
        Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one 
        of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river 
        the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower,
         and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families
          with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more. </p>

        <p>This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips.
             You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.
        Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking
         scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled
          not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.
        CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in
         the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide
          variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people are familiar 
          with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both. </p>
